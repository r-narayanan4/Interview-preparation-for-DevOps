# GitLab Overview

## 1. What is GitLab?

GitLab is a web-based tool designed to assist with visualizing and managing your Git projects. It includes features such as Git repository management, code reviews, issue tracking, wikis, and more. Teams can collaborate using issues, milestones, line-by-line code review, or view activity streams of projects.

## 2. What is the Pipeline in GitLab?

A pipeline in GitLab is a group of jobs that get executed in stages. All jobs in a stage are executed in parallel, and if they all succeed, the pipeline moves on to the next stage. If one of the jobs fails, the next stage is not (usually) executed.

## 3. What is the Difference Between Fork and Branch in GitLab?

- **Forking:** Forking creates a full copy of your repository, whereas branching only adds a branch to your existing tree.
- **Branching:** Branching adds a branch to your existing repository without creating a full copy. The file size of the branch can vary depending on the branch that you are on.

## 4. What is GitLab Runner?

GitLab Runner is a build instance used to run jobs over multiple machines and send the results to GitLab. It can be placed on separate users, servers, and local machines.

## 5. What are Shared Runners?

Shared Runners are useful for jobs across multiple projects with similar requirements. Instead of using multiple runners for many projects, you can use a single or a small number of runners to handle multiple projects.

## 6. What are Specific Runners?

Specific Runners are useful to deploy a certain project if jobs have specific requirements or demands. You can register a specific runner by using the project registration token.

## 7. Example gitlab-ci.yml File:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the 'Hello World' app"

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Testing the 'Hello World' app"
```

## 8. Where are GitLab Artifacts Stored?

GitLab artifacts are stored by default in `/home/git/gitlab/shared/artifacts`. Artifacts are files generated by your CI/CD pipelines, such as compiled binaries or test reports, which can be downloaded and used for further analysis or deployment.

## 9. What is GitLab CI YML?

The GitLab CI YML file is a configuration file written in YAML format that you create in your project's root directory. It defines the structure of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for your project, including stages, jobs, and scripts to be executed.

## 10. What are GitLab Pipelines?

GitLab Pipelines are a set of CI/CD workflows defined in the gitlab-ci.yml file. They automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. Pipelines consist of stages, which contain jobs that execute specific tasks. Each job is executed by a runner, and the results are displayed in the GitLab UI.
