# Database Management System (DBMS) and SQL Basics

## Database Management System (DBMS) Basics

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that facilitates the creation, organization, and manipulation of databases. Key concepts include:

- **Data Storage**: DBMS stores data in structured formats, enabling efficient retrieval and manipulation.
- **Data Retrieval**: Users can query the database to retrieve specific information using structured query languages.
- **Data Security**: DBMS ensures data security through access controls and encryption.
- **Data Integrity**: DBMS maintains data integrity by enforcing constraints and rules.
- **Concurrency Control**: Manages simultaneous access to the database to prevent data corruption.

## Relational and Non-Relational Databases

### Relational Databases

Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns. They use structured query language (SQL) for querying and managing data. Key concepts include:

- **Tables**: Store data in rows and columns.
- **Columns**: Represent attributes or fields of data.
- **Rows**: Individual records in a table.
- **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each row.
- **Foreign Key**: Establishes a relationship between two tables.
- **Normalization**: Process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency.

### Non-Relational Databases

Non-relational databases (NoSQL) store data in various formats such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. They offer flexibility and scalability, often used for large-scale distributed systems. Key concepts include:

- **Document Stores**: Store data as documents (e.g., JSON, XML).
- **Key-Value Stores**: Store data as key-value pairs.
- **Column-Family Stores**: Store data in columns rather than rows.
- **Graph Databases**: Store data in nodes and edges.

## SQL (Structured Query Language) Basics

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases. Basic SQL commands include:

- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
- **INSERT**: Add new records to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modify existing records in a table.
- **DELETE**: Remove records from a table.
- **CREATE**: Create new tables, indexes, or views.
- **ALTER**: Modify the structure of a database.
- **DROP**: Delete objects from a database.

SQL allows users to perform various operations on relational databases, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation and management.
